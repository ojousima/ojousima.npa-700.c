 * @brief Interface functions to NPA-700 series differential pressure sensors.
 *
 * This driver provides platform-independent initialization, reading and uninitialization
 * of NPA-700 series sensors. Configuring EEPROM of the sensors is not supported by this
 * driver.
 *
 * User must provide I2C write- and read functions as function pointers on initialization.
 * It is critical to ensure that write- and read functions will never block.
